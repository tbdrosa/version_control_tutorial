1.  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

   It would be best to keep a remote repo when collaborating with several other engineers on a specific project. In the case of an app or program that is in development. If you keep all your updates changes locally - no one else will be able to see them and the progress to the project would be a bit stagnent.
   
2.  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I'm not sure for this answer, but for me - it may not be completely necessesary to constantly be pulling the changes I made to GitHub. I hope to learn more about this in future videos for Lesson 4 in Udacity.
