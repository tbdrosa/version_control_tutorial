How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was quite handy and allowed me to quickly figure out the difference between files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    For the long term this would allow me to notice how far I've come in terms of the applications lifetime.. where I started and where it is now. It will also help if I ever mess something up - so I have easy access to go back to a time when it was working.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pros are essentially, you have control of what gets saved (what is most important) this can be good since you are not overwhelmed with a lot of saved files and commits. Contrastingly, if you don't keep good repitition/ or a good track on saving this can also be bad as well.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
