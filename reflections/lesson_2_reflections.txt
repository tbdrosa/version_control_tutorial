1.  What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repo it creates an invisible git file which will therefore keep track of all future updates made inside the repo. You don't need to do it. However, it is highly encouraged to keep track - jsut incase you make an error or a bug appears sometime in the near future.
